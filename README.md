# subcrit_reactor_n_flow

Run `neutron_flux.ipynb`. 

My main goal in this "project" is familiarizing myself with IPython, Sympy, Numpy, etc. 
There might be errors since I didn't check it thoroughly.  

Also, the project is rather problematic, since the fuel rods were not available
during the experiment.
