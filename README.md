# subcrit_reactor_n_flow

Click `neutron_flux.ipynb` in the main folder. Github will take care of the rest. 

My main goal in this "project" is familiarizing myself with IPython, Sympy, Numpy, etc. 
There might be errors since I didn't check it thoroughly.  

Also, the project is rather problematic, since the fuel rods were not available
during the experiment.
