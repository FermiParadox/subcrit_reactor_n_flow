# subcrit_reactor_n_flow

Click [`this`](https://github.com/FermiParadox/subcrit_reactor_n_flow/blob/master/neutron_flux.ipynb). Github will take care of the rest. 

My main goal in this "project" is familiarizing myself with IPython, Sympy, Numpy, etc. 
There might be errors since I didn't check it thoroughly.  

Also, the experiment was rather problematic, since the fuel rods were not available
during the experiment.
